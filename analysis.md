# Analysis of User Similarity Results

The user–item matrix shows which users rated which movies and how strongly they felt about them. When two users give similar ratings to the same set of movies, their rows in the matrix look similar, which leads to a higher cosine similarity score. For example, users who consistently rate the same movies as high or low end up with vectors that point in a similar direction, even if their exact rating values differ slightly. Missing ratings, which we fill with zeros, imply no expressed preference and reduce the direct overlap between users.

Collaborative filtering uses these similarity scores to make personalized recommendations. In a user–user approach, the system first finds the nearest neighbors of a target user, based on cosine similarity over their rating histories. Then it looks at items that similar users liked but the target user has not rated yet. Movies that receive high ratings from close neighbors are strong candidates to recommend, because the model assumes that users with similar tastes will enjoy similar items.

However, user–user similarity has several important limitations. When the rating matrix is sparse and most users rate only a few items, it is harder to compute reliable similarity scores because there is little overlap. New users face the cold start problem, since they have not rated enough items to find meaningful neighbors. At large scale, computing and updating pairwise similarities for millions of users can also be computationally expensive. Finally, different similarity metrics (such as cosine, Pearson correlation, or adjusted cosine) can lead to different neighbor sets, which in turn affects recommendation quality and diversity.
